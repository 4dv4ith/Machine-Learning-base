'''Given is a list of of words, wordlist, and a string, name. 
Write a Python function which takes wordlist and name as input and returns a tuple. 
The first element of the output tuple is the number of words in the wordlist which have name as a
substring in it. 
The second element of the tuple is a list showing 
the index at which the name occurs in each of the words of the wordlist and a 0 if it doesnâ€™t occur.'''
